# FullStack Web Developer Challenge

For Frontend I used :

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Typescript-333333?style=flat&logo=Typescript)
![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-333333?style=flat&logo=angular)

(First project working on Angular and Typescript)

For Backend I used:

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/Typescript-333333?style=flat&logo=Typescript)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-333333?style=flat&logo=node.js)
![Swagger](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swagger-API-333333?style=flat&logo=swagger)

This project is based on a challenge I completed for a job position.
I completed both Front & Back End in 6 days (while still attending bootcamp)

It is my first try using Typescript

## The Tasks:

You can view what were the tasks assigned for each part on each folder.
I developed seperately Frontend to Backend.

In both cases you can see the original code (it may also be commented out)!

I have changed some information for the FrontEnd to not use the API and to be able to show the design without needing verification.
I did this mainly because the APIs are not always working and I wanted to keep having a design showing.
